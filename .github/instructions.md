# GitHub Copilot instructions for the axios repository

Welcome to the axios repository! We appreciate your help. To make sure your contributions are in line with our project's standards, please follow these guidelines when using GitHub Copilot.

## 📚 General Guidelines

* **Follow the Style Guide:** Our primary goal is to maintain a consistent code style. Before generating code, please review our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for details on linting and style.
* **Prioritize Readability:** Code should be clear and easy for humans to understand.
* **Test Coverage is Required:** Any new feature or bug fix *must* include corresponding tests. You can use Copilot to help draft tests, but you must verify they are thorough and correct.

## ✅ Do

* **Do** use Copilot to understand existing code by asking it to "explain this function."
* **Do** use Copilot to generate boilerplate for tests, but always customize the assertions.
* **Do** ask Copilot to check for edge cases (e.g., "what happens if this argument is null?").
* **Do** use ES6+ syntax (like `const`, `let`, arrow functions, and Promises) where appropriate.

## ❌ Do Not

* **Do not** submit code generated by Copilot without thoroughly testing it yourself.
* **Do not** add new dependencies without discussing it in an issue first.
* **Do not** introduce breaking changes to the public API without approval.
* **Do not** add large, complex code blocks without clear comments explaining the "why."
